- Quizes are composed of rounds which are made up of Questions which you the Player answer.
- The current objects are:
  -   Player(non functional)
  -   Rounds
  -   Questions
- There is a main menu which you can use to edit rounds and questions, edit players(not yet functional) and try out the quiz
- You will be able to add , delete ,list and update objects using a menu.
- You can choose specific object attributes to update
- Currently there is CRUD functionality for Rounds objects and Questions object, you are also able to save and load them to XML.
- When you try the quiz you first are displayed the rounds which are complete or incomplete.
- A round is complete when you answer all its questions correctly in 1 attempt.
- Each time you retry a round your attempt counter goes up
- Possible answers are displayed to you during the quiz and you have to type in the correct answer
